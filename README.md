# Facial-Expression-via-Machine-Learning

In this project, we built mainly deep learning models to recogenize human facial expressions.
Models are built based on Tensorflow in python, and encapsulated.
The data set we use is fer2013, also incoporated in data folder.

# ReadMe First

1. We trained the models and save them in "Trained" file, you can use Call_Trained_Model in folder to call these models and make prediction
2. Data preprocessing functions are stored at "data" folder
3. Graphs contains network computation graph produced by tensorboard, be sure to insall tensorflow and in python enviroment to open them
5. We also built RNNs. They can be found in "Models" folder.
6. We did not upload the dataset, please find csv version online and use data preproccessing functions to handle it.
